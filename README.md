fuelbox-mp3
===========
A mp3 player controller board with LM386 op-amp, using touch sensor, push button and light sensor as trigger.

TODO
====
* 2032 Battery max discharge current is only 10mA while mp3 module draws 85mA @3.6v
* TOUCH sensor is not supposed to be grounded (GND plane may cause problem)
* Remove vias that connect to TOUCH sensor
